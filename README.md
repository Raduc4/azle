## License

Azle is licensed under the MIT license found in the LICENSE file. The copyright is intended to be assigned to the holders of the AZLE token found at canister id nlhft-2iaaa-aaaae-qaaua-cai on the Internet Computer. Full copyright assignment may require written and signed agreements which have not yet been implemented.

The AZLE token code and supply is currently controlled entirely by Jordan Last (lastmjs). The tentative plan is to decentralize the AZLE ownership, the AZLE canister, and the Azle repository over time. The repository for the AZLE token can be found here: https://github.com/lastmjs/extendable-token-azle
